# PracticalMachineLearning

The goal of our project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We may use any of the other variables to predict with. We should descibe how to build our model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why we made the choices to select the parcticular prediction models over the others. We will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
