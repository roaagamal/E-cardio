# Predictions using the Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset

Based on a dataset provide by HAR http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har try to train a predictive model to predict what exercise was performed using a dataset with 159 features

## Executive Summary

Weâ€™ll take the following steps:

Process the data, for use of this project
Explore the data, especially focussing on the two paramaters we are interested in
Model selection, where we try different models to help us answer our questions
Model examination, to see wether our best model holds up to our standards
A Conclusion where we answer the questions based on the data
Predicting the classification of the model on test set
